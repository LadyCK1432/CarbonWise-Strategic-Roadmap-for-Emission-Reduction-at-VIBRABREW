# SCMission 2025 â€“ Supply Chain Decarbonization Case (Round 2)

**Team:** T.N.A (Thuy Trang, Phuong Thao, Bao Anh, Quang Nhat)  
**Competition:** SCMission 2025 â€“ Round 2 (72-Hour Hackathon)  
**Organizer:** Foreign Trade University HCMC & SCMission Team  
**Challenge Theme:** *Decarbonizing Inbound Logistics and Warehousing for VIBRABREW Co.*  
**Time Limit:** 72 hours  

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project was developed as part of SCMission 2025's sustainability case competition. Our team acted as consultants for VIBRABREW Co., one of Vietnamâ€™s largest beverage producers, to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from inbound logistics and warehouse operations. We applied a data-driven approach to identify carbon hotspots and design short-term and long-term decarbonization strategies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Calculate GHG emissions from inbound logistics (activity-based) and warehouse operations (fuel-based)
- Identify top emission-contributing routes and warehouses
- Propose actionable plans including **modal shift**, **EV truck adoption**, **route optimization**, **LED retrofit**, **solar panel installation**, and **supplier ESG alignment**
- Balance carbon impact with cost, service level, and feasibility

## ðŸ“Š Methodology & Tools

### Inbound Logistics â€“ Activity-Based Calculation:
- **Load ratio calculation**
- **Interpolated emission factor** based on payload using linear forecasting
- **Top 10 emission routes** identified
- **Route optimization** using K-means clustering & Solver in Excel

### Inbound Warehousing â€“ Fuel-Based Calculation:
- Converted energy consumption (kWh, LPG, Diesel) to MJ
- Calculated GHG using **EF Ã— LHV** method
- Proposed electrification of forklifts, solar energy integration, and LED upgrades

### Tools & Techniques:
- **Excel (FORECAST.LINEAR, Solver, Data Viz)**  
- **Python (K-means, Elbow Method)**  
- **SPSS Regression** (emission sensitivity analysis)  
- **PowerPoint** (slide preparation)

## ðŸš€ Key Results

- Up to **72% COâ‚‚e reduction** in inbound operations  
- **Modal shift from trucks to sea freight** contributed up to 63% reduction  
- **Electrification** of forklifts and transition from LPG/diesel cut warehouse emissions by 50%  
- Optimized transportation network using clustering and transshipment  
- Designed ESG-based supplier evaluation model
